# Getting started

## Requirements

- WordPress 6.5+
- PHP 8.1+
- An [EpassCard](https://app.epasscard.com) account with at least one pass template
- At least one supported plugin:
  - **Membership:** MemberPress, Paid Memberships Pro, Simple Membership, Ultimate Membership Pro
  - **Subscriptions:** WooCommerce Subscriptions
  - **Events:** Event Tickets, Events Manager
  - **Gift cards:** PW WooCommerce Gift Cards, YITH WooCommerce Gift Cards

## Installation

1. Upload the `epasscard` folder to `wp-content/plugins/` or install from your distribution package.
2. Activate **EpassCard** in **Plugins**.
3. Go to **EpassCard → Connection**.

## Basic setup (5 steps)

1. **Connect** — Paste your API key or sign in with EpassCard credentials to generate one.
2. **Enable integrations** — On the Connection page, check the plugins you use and click **Save integrations**.
3. **Open an integration** — e.g. **EpassCard → MemberPress** or **EpassCard → Event Tickets**.
4. **Map templates** — For each product, level, ticket, event, or gift card product, choose a pass template and map fields.
5. **Issue passes** — Passes are created automatically when members subscribe, attendees register, or gift cards are issued (per module rules), or manually via **Create pass**.

## What happens after setup

- When a record qualifies, EpassCard creates a wallet pass via the API and stores the link locally.
- Profile / status changes can update or revoke existing passes (see each integration).
- Optional reminder pushes use native plugin timing (MemberPress, WooCommerce Subscriptions) or EpassCard’s daily cron (other modules).
- Pass links can be emailed automatically, included in WooCommerce order emails, or viewed in My Account / MemberPress account where supported.
